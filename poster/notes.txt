# Poster for Symposium

Main idea: Present techniques from book. 

- Use template from Giuseppe
- Light on theory, many graphics
- One example dataset (can be simulated and funny) that is used all through poster
- Integrate QR codes for software and book (one QR code per block?)
- INtegrate graphice from book somewhere?
- Add black box graphic with the "?"
- Data: 3 features (1 cat, 2 num), numerical outcome, relatable, rent, non-linear, interactions.
- data house value: features living area and location (cat) and cats are allowed (interaction with living area).
- do little diagram for taks: symbols for living area, cats allowed and location influence rent.
- Boxes
    - Introduction: What is ML, why interpretability
    - Data: Explain data and model. Idea: fuse intro and data, make more tangible through application focus
    - white box models (linear models+, decision tree, rules)
    - feature effects (PDP, ICE, ALE)
    - feature importance (permutation importance)
    - Global surrogate models (idea: integrate into white box as additional possibility)
    - Explaining individual predictions (Shapley, LIME, counterfactual explanations)
    - References
